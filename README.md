# 🧠 Advanced Python – Master Repository

Welcome to the **Advanced Python Tasks** repository — a collection of structured assignments and practical notebooks aimed at strengthening and applying advanced Python concepts. This repository is organized into two active branches:

---

## 🌿 Branches Overview

### 📘 `assignment`
A series of structured academic-style exercises designed to cover essential concepts in Python beyond the basics.

**Topics include:**
- Functional programming (map, filter, reduce)
- File handling and exception management
- Regular expressions and text processing
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and inheritance
- Mixed applications of advanced Python logic with ML

### 🧪 `learning`
This branch includes practical and real-world Python utilities used in data preprocessing, analysis, and automation tasks.

**Topics include:**
- Feature selection and scaling
- Manual vs. library-based preprocessing
- NumPy operations
- Outlier detection
- Pandas and Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis
